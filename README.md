## Feedback and Support
Considering the current work load I currently have in college, and the work load I will have in university next year I don't think this coin flip app will receive updates in the near future, not any time soon at least. 

Let me know what do you think of it, what you like about it and what I could've done better.

## Future Plans
For future projects, I plan to have my projects more organized, especially with github - specifically making commits and labeling them as "a" over 70 times! Let's try not to do that again. ðŸ˜…
